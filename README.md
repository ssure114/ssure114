## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## My Bio
Iâ€™m **Sreya Suresh**, a UX Design major at Arizona State University with a background in architecture and interior design. Iâ€™ve worked across different areas of design, from being a junior architect to taking on UX/UI projects in both academic and professional settings. I have no coding knowledge prior to taking this class, I enjoy the challenges I'm facing as I learn something new. Iâ€™m passionate about Cooking, Baking and artwork.
