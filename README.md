## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## My Bio
Iâ€™m Sreya Suresh, a UX Design major at Arizona State University with a background in architecture and interior design. Iâ€™ve worked across different areas of design, from being a junior architect to taking on UX/UI projects in both academic and professional settings.cMy experience includes usability testing, website redesigns, and app development with a strong focus on accessibility and user-centered design. Iâ€™m passionate about blending creativity with functionality, and I often draw inspiration from Indian textiles, music, and cultural motifs to bring unique perspectives into my work.
